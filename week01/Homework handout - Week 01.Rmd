# Homework Objectives
# In this homework, you will:
# - Import a dataset related to ecology and perform basic exploration.
# - Manipulate the data using `tidyverse` functions.
# - Reshape data and create new variables.
# - Group and summarize data to gain ecological insights.
# 
# We will use the `palmerpenguins` dataset for this assignment, which contains data about three species of penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

# Install/load and load the required packages
# Remember, if you have previously installed a package (like tidyverse) you do not need to install it again, just load it
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)

# Part A: Import and Explore the Dataset
# 1. Load the penguins dataset
data("penguins")

# 2. **Inspect the first few rows of the dataset**. What variables are included in the dataset?
head(penguins)
# Variables include: species, island, bill length and depth, flipper length, body mass, sex and year

# 3. **Check the dimensions of the dataset.** How many rows and columns are there?
dim(penguins)
# There are 8 columns and 344 rows

# 4. **Get summary statistics** for each variable in the dataset.
summary(penguins)




# Part B: Basic Data Manipulation
# 1. **Select specific columns**. 
#    Create a new dataset with only the following columns: `species`, `bill_length_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, and `body_mass_g`. 
#    Print the first rows of this dataset using the head() function. 
penguins_selected <- penguins %>% select(species, bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g)
head(penguins_selected)


# 2. **Filter the dataset** to only include penguins with a `body_mass_g` greater than 4000 grams. Print the first rows.
penguins_filtered <- penguins %>% filter(body_mass_g > 4000)
head(penguins_filtered)


# 3. **Arrange the dataset** by `bill_length_mm` in ascending order. Print the first rows. 
penguins_arranged <- penguins %>% arrange(bill_length_mm)
head(penguins_arranged)

# 4. **Create a new variable** that calculates the ratio of bill length (`bill_length_mm`) to flipper length (`flipper_length_mm`). 
#   Call the new variable `bill_flipper_ratio`. Print the first rows. 
penguins <- penguins %>% mutate(bill_flipper_ratio = bill_length_mm / flipper_length_mm)
head(penguins)


# Part C: Grouping and Summarizing Data
# 1. **Group the data by penguin species (`species`)** and calculate the following summaries:
#    - The average body mass (`body_mass_g`) for each species.
#    - The maximum flipper length (`flipper_length_mm`) for each species.
#    Print the grouped dataframe
penguins_grouped <- penguins %>% group_by(species)
average_body_mass_by_species <- penguins_grouped %>% summarise(avg = mean(body_mass_g))
max_flipper_length_by_species <- penguins_grouped %>% summarise(max = max(flipper_length_mm))
head(penguins_grouped)
head(average_body_mass_by_species)
head(max_flipper_length_by_species)


# 2. **Interpret the results**. Which species has the highest average body mass? Which species has the longest maximum flipper length?



# Part D: Reshaping Data
# 1. **Convert the `penguins` dataset from wide to long format** using the `pivot_longer()` function. 
#    Focus on the columns `bill_length_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, and `body_mass_g`. 
#    Print the first rows. 




# 2. **Now, convert the data back to wide format** using the `pivot_wider()` function. Print the first rows. 




# Step E: Handling Missing Data
# 1. **Identify rows with `NA` values** in any column. Print these rows. 



# 2. **Remove rows with missing values** from the dataset. 
#.   Print the first rows. 



# 3. **Fill missing values** in the `body_mass_g` column with the mean body mass.
#    Print the first rows. 




# Step F: Save the Modified Dataset
# 1. **Save the final cleaned and modified dataset** as a CSV file.
